Introduction-

Crowd detection, counting, and queue wait time prediction are critical tasks across sectors like public safety, customer service, and retail analytics. With recent advancements in computer vision, deep learning models have enabled more accurate and real-time crowd monitoring. This project explores two independent models to address these challenges: YOLOv8, a high-performance real-time object detection model, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for density estimation.

Related Studies and Applications-

YOLO Models for Crowd Detection and Counting
The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models has been frequently used in crowd detection tasks due to its real-time processing capabilitieEarlier versions, such as YOLOv4 and YOLOv5, have been applied in public areas like stadiums and train stations for people detection and counting, but struggled with high-density and overlapping individuals in very crowded environments. YOLOv8, the latest in this series, improves upon previous models with anchor-free detection and optimized architectures for faster and more accurate identification of individuals, making it particularly effective for real-time crowd monitoring in dynamic spaces. 
In this project, YOLOv8 is used to detect and count individuals in crowded areas, addressing limitations seen in earlier versions and enabling a more responsive and precise monitoring system.

CNN-Based Models for Crowd Density Estimation
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely recognized for their accuracy in crowd density estimation, especially in settings where individuals are closely packed and often occlude one another. CNNs have been used to create density maps that estimate the number of people in a given area without identifying individuals, making them ideal for environments with extremely high crowd density. Previous studies applying CNNs have demonstrated strong performance in estimating crowd sizes, especially in static or semi-static crowd images. 
This project leverages a CNN model specifically for density estimation to assess crowd sizes and predict wait times in queues, offering an alternative to individual tracking by focusing on overall density.

Uniqueness of This Project-

Real-Time Detection and Counting with YOLOv8
YOLOv8 enables real-time detection and counting of individuals in dynamic, high-density environments. Its ability to rapidly identify and count people makes it suitable for applications requiring immediate crowd monitoring and queue management insights in high-traffic areas.
Density-Based Queue Wait Time Prediction with CNN
The CNN model provides crowd density estimation, which is used to predict queue wait times based on density rather than individual tracking. This application is particularly useful in dense queues or highly crowded spaces where individual detection is challenging. By focusing on crowd density, the CNN approach allows for more accurate queue management and predictive wait time analysis in high-demand environments.

Conclusion-

This project uses YOLOv8 and CNN independently to provide two complementary approaches to crowd detection and queue management. YOLOv8 excels in real-time individual detection, making it ideal for dynamic crowd monitoring, while CNN is used for density-based estimation in highly crowded settings, enhancing queue wait time prediction. Together, these approaches contribute to more effective crowd and queue management in public and commercial spaces, offering versatile solutions tailored to specific crowd dynamics.
